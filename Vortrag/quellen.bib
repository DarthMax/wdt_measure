@inproceedings{gao2011hot,
	Abstract = {Keyphrase consisting of several words is viewed as the phrase that represent the topic and the content of the whole text. Extracting keyphrase is a good way to detect hot topics and tracking topics from news report. In this paper, a two-step keyphrase extraction method based on TF*PDF is proposed. In the first step, the position-weighted IT*PDF algorithm is proposed to obtain candidate hot term list and the bursty value of term is used to filter the noise in the list. In the second step, a phrase identification process combines hot terms into phrases using position information, frequency information etc. At last the position-weighted TF*PDF algorithm are also used to weight the phrase, and the top k phrases are chosen as hot keyphrases. The experiments on the real web data indicate that our extraction method provides solutions with improved quality.},

@inproceedings{jahnavi2013hot,
	Abstract = {Internet based news documents are the basic information transmission media. In such a case detecting hot topics and tracking the event development is most important. However, it is almost impossible to view all the generated topics, due to its large amount of size. Therefore it is necessary to rank the topics. The topic ranking should be done on the importance basis. But this importance is determined by how frequently a topic appears and this importance varies in different time slots. For extracting hot topics, most of the text mining approaches with vector space model need to determine the weighting of the feature terms. Existing traditional algorithms can't achieve high accuracy for retrieving hot terms, because they have not considered position, scattering and topicality. This paper presents an innovative and effective hot term extraction by considering position, scattering and topicality of terms along with frequency.},

@inproceedings{viermetz2008tracking,
	Abstract = {For companies acting on a global scale, the necessity to monitor and analyze news channels and consumer-generated media on the Web, such as weblogs and n news-groups, is steadily increasing. In particular the identification of novel trends and upcoming issues, as well as their dynamic evolution over time, is of utter importance to corporate communications and market analysts. Automated machine learning systems using clustering techniques have only partially succeeded in addressing these newly arising requirements, failing in their endeavor to properly assign short-term hype topics to long-term trends. We propose an approach which allows to monitor news wire on different levels of temporal granularity, extracting key-phrases that reflect short-term topics as well as longer-term trends by means of statistical language modelling. Moreover, our approach allows for assigning those windows of smaller scope to those of longer intervals.},

@incollection{aggarwal2012mining,
	Abstract = {The large amount of text data which are continuously produced over time in a variety of large scale applications such as social networks results in massive streams of data. Typically massive text streams are created by very large scale interactions of individuals, or by structured creations of particular kinds of content by dedicated organizations. An example in the latter category would be the massive text streams created by news-wire services. Such text streams provide unprecedented challenges to data mining algorithms from an efficiency perspective. In this chapter, we review text stream mining algorithms for a wide variety of problems in data mining such as clustering, classification and topic modeling. We also discuss a number of future challenges in this area of research.},

@article{gupta2014outlier,
	Abstract = {Outlier (or anomaly) detection is a very broad field which has been studied in the context of a large number of research areas like statistics, data mining, sensor networks, environmental science, distributed systems, spatio-temporal mining, etc. Initial research in outlier detection focused on time series-based outliers (in statistics). Since then, outlier detection has been studied on a large variety of data types including high-dimensional data, uncertain data, stream data, network data, time series data, spatial data, and spatio-temporal data. While there have been many tutorials and surveys for general outlier detection, we focus on outlier detection for temporal data in this book. A large number of applications generate temporal datasets. For example, in our everyday life, various kinds of records like credit, personnel, financial, judicial, medical, etc., are all temporal. This stresses the need for an organized and detailed study of outliers with respect to such temporal data. In the past decade, there has been a lot of research on various forms of temporal data including consecutive data snapshots, series of data snapshots and data streams. Besides the initial work on time series, researchers have focused on rich forms of data including multiple data streams, spatio-temporal data, network data, community distribution data, etc.

Compared to general outlier detection, techniques for temporal outlier detection are very different. In this book, we will present an organized picture of both recent and past research in temporal outlier detection. We start with the basics and then ramp up the reader to the main ideas in state-of-the-art outlier detection techniques. We motivate the importance of temporal outlier detection and brief the challenges beyond usual outlier detection. Then, we list down a taxonomy of proposed techniques for temporal outlier detection. Such techniques broadly include statistical techniques (like AR models, Markov models, histograms, neural networks), distance- and density-based approaches, grouping-based approaches (clustering, community detection), network-based approaches, and spatio-temporal outlier detection approaches. We summarize by presenting a wide collection of applications where temporal outlier detection techniques have been applied to discover interesting outliers.
